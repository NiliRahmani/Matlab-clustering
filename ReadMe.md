Clustering project

This is a project which accepts a sequence of values including voltages and tempretures and the purpose of the project is to distinguish which one is positive voltage, which tempreture and which is negative voltage. The pattern of the values are like:

TTTTTT VP VN TTTTTTTT VN VP TTTTTT VP VN TTTTTT.... 

Where T is temperature, VP is positive voltage and VN is negative voltage.

I would like to select 10 T values, all the values for VP, all the values for VN, and again 10 T values. That would be for the first data point and it would be repeated throughout the file.
